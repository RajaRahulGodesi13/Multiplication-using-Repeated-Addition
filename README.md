# Multiplication-using-Repeated-Addition
Implemented a digital block that can perform multiplication of two given numbers using the concept of repeated
addition in Verilog HDL. The Digital Block comprises of Adder, Counter, Comparator and register components.
â€“ Their functionality is controlled by a control pathwhcih was implemented using Finite State Machine(FSM). Tools:
